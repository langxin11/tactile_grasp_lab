# 1 Introduction

The PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) is a system of (up to) two PapillArray Tactile Sensor arrays and a Controller. Each PapillArray Tactile Sensor array can measure 3D displacement, 3D force, and vibration on each sensing element, as well as global 3D force, global 3D torque, the onset of slip, and friction. The Controller supplies power for (up to) two sensors and coordinates the simultaneous data acquisition from up to two PapillArray Tactile Sensors; i.e., coordinates sampling of the 9 pillars if one sensor is connected to the Controller, 18 pillars if two sensors are connected to the Controller. The Development Kit is shipped with visualisation software, C++ and Python libraries for Windows and Linux environments and ROS and ROS2 node for developing software control algorithms using the sensor signals. 

The main components of the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) are shown in Figure 1.1, connected to a laptop running the visualisation software.

Figure 1.1 – The PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0). Laptop not included.


This document is an installation and operation manual for the Python Library which was provided on the Contactile USB flash drive that was shipped with the Development Kit. 

# 2 Safety

# 2.1 General

The customer should verify that the maximum loads and moments expected during operation fall within the sensing range of the sensor as outside this range, sensor reading accuracy is not guaranteed (refer to Document #PTS_2.0_SPEC_DEC21). Particular attention should be paid to dynamic loads caused by robot acceleration and deceleration if the sensors are mounted on robotic equipment. These forces can be many multiples of the value of static forces in high acceleration or deceleration situations. 

# 2.2 Explanation of warnings

The warnings included here are specific to the product(s) covered by this manual. It is expected that the user heed all warnings from the manufacturers of other components used in the installation.

Caution indicates that a situation could result in damage to the product and/or the other system components. 

# 2.3 Precautions

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/fd919622-544e-4409-a0c1-7f9102f11692/e65bdffcf8d0d0465c3ba491f48e3f7c7f432532de181cb3c1b6e8686d21e113.jpg)


DANGER: Do not attempt to disassemble the sensor. This could damage the sensor and will invalidate the calibration. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/fd919622-544e-4409-a0c1-7f9102f11692/08933b25ed867f65a99c5724ab2633853a011e2148b2c75ddb53619c5864b48f.jpg)


DANGER: Do not attempt to drill, tap, machine, or otherwise modify the sensor casing. This could damage the sensor and will void invalidated the calibration.

CAUTION: Sensors may exhibit a small offset in readings when exposed to intense light sources. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/fd919622-544e-4409-a0c1-7f9102f11692/d50db5d0979f2807752e942d20a496a8702658775791b8f93bc166955e48c02e.jpg)


CAUTION: Exceptionally strong and changing electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, constitute a possible source of interference with the operation of the sensor and Controller. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/fd919622-544e-4409-a0c1-7f9102f11692/810942e9c67787450df43ed84ed2fd780c88a32020e86331ff036901e67e14dc.jpg)


CAUTION: Temperature variations can cause drift in sensor readings. Some temperature compensation is performed. However, bias removal in software prior to operation is necessary, and it is recommended that biasing is performed each time the sensor is known to be unloaded. 

# 3 Getting started

This section contains instructions for setting up and using PapillArray Tactile Sensor Python Library. It is recommended that first time users first read the preceding Safety section, then read through this section to get more familiar with the system. 

# 3.1 Hardware installation

The Python Library is used with the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (Beta v2.0). The Controller should be connected to the PapillArray Tactile Sensors, then the Controller should be connected via the micro USB port on the Controller to a PC running LINUX before you can use the Python Library. For more information about connecting the sensors and powering on the Controller, refer to Document #PTSDK_2.0_MAN_DEC21.

# 5 Writing a user application using the Python Library

This section contains code snippets to explain each step required to write a user application that uses the Python Library to monitor two PapillArray Tactile Sensors. The full example can be found in the ptsdk_pybind_example.py file in the relevant PythonXXX folder (where XXX is WIN or LIN for Windows and Linux, respectively). 

# 5.1 Import files

These examples require the imports listed in Example 5.1. 


Example 5.1 – Imports for the example user application


```txt
import PTSD_CXX_Pybind 
```

# 5.2 Initialising PTSDKSensor and PTSDKListener objects

To initialise a PTSDKListener object, first, the PTSDKSensor objects must be initialised. The following information is required to initialise the PTSDKSensor objects. An example of initialising two PTSDKSensor objects then initialising the PTSDKListener object is shown in Example 5.2. 


Example 5.2 – Initialising two PTSDKSensor objects and a PTSDKListener object


```txt
isLogging = True

# Initialise sensors
sen0 = PTSD_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKSensor()
sen1 = PTSD_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKSensor()

# Initialise listener and add sensors
listener = PTSD_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKListener(isLogging)
listener.addSensor(sen0)
listener.addSensor(sen1) 
```

# 5.3 Connecting to the COM port and listening for data

After initialising the PTSDKListener, a serial connection must be established. To connect to the COM port, the name of the COM port assigned to the connected Controller must be known. Once the PTSDKListener has established a connection with the COM port of the Controller, the Controller will begin transmitting data through the serial connection. 

There are two methods by which a user defined program can retrieve data from the Controller: 

1. Single thread 

2. Multi-threaded 

Note: There should be a COM port associated with the Controller (to power the Controller, the micro-USB should be connected between the Controller and the PC). 

Note: In Linux, the COM port usually appears as /dev/ttyACM0. Ensure that the user has permissions to read/write to this COM port (by adding the user to the dialout group). 

# 5.3.1 COM port configuration parameters

The COM port configuration parameters are first required. An example of initialising the COM port configuration parameters is shown in Example 5.3. 


Example 5.3 – Connecting the PTSDKListener object to the COM port and listen for data in a single thread


```python
port = "\"\\.\\COM3"    # The name of the COM port to connect with
    # For Windows, the additional '\' characters are required
    # For Linux, this could be "/dev/ttyACM0"
rate = 115200    # The rate of the serial connection
parity = 0    # 0=PARITY_NONE, 1=PARITY_ODD, 2=PARITY_EVEN
byteSize = '\u0008'    # The number of bits in a byte, as a single Unicode character 
```

# 5.3.2 Single thread

The structure of a user defined application using a single thread to retrieve sensor data from the Controller is shown in Example 5.4. 


Example 5.4 – Connecting to the COM port and reading data in a single thread


```python
# Single thread example
isFlush = True
pillarInd = 0
s0p0forces = [0,0,0]

# Connect to the COM port
res = listener.connect(port, rate, parity, byteSize)
if res == 0:
    print('main(): Successfully connected to the COM port')
else:
    print('main(): FAILED to connect to the COM port and start to listen')
    exit()

# Read the next sample
for i in range(0,1000):
    res = listener.readNextSample(True)
    if not res:
    print("main(): FAILED to read the next sample")
    break
    # User application code - do something with the data
    s0p0forces = sen0.getPillarForces(pillarInd)
    if i%100 == 0:
    for dimInd in range(0,PTSDK_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKConstants.NDIM):
    print('SOP0: F' + str(dimInd) + ': ' + str(s0p0forces[dimInd]))

# Disconnect from the COM port
listener disconnect() 
```

# 5.3.3 Multi-threaded

The PTSDKListener object can launch a thread which listens for and processes the incoming data packets. An example of how to connect to the COM port and start listening for data using a new thread is shown in Example 5.5. 


Example 5.5 – Connecting to the COM port and listening for data in a multi-threaded application


```python
# Multi-threaded example
pillarInd = 0
s0p0disp = [0,0,0]

# Connect to COM port and start listening
isFlush = True
res = listener.connectAndStartListening(port, rate, parity, byteSize, isFlush)
if res == 0:
    print('main(): Successfully connected COM port and starting to listen')
else:
    print('main(): FAILED to connect to COM port and start to listen')
    exit()

# User application code - do something with the data
for i in range(0,10):
    force = sen0.getGlobalForce()
    s0p0disp = sen0.getPillarDisplacements(pillarInd)
    for dimInd in range(0,PTSDK_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKConstants.NDIM):
    print('S0: global F' + str(dimInd) + ' = ' + str(force[dimInd]))
    print('S0P0: D' + str(dimInd) + ': ' + str(s0p0disp[dimInd]))

time.sleep(1)

# Stop listening and disconnect from COM port
listener.stopListeningAndDisconnect() 
```

# 5.4 Biasing the sensors

Biasing refers to removing any offset in the pillar readings when the pillars are unloaded. It is recommended that the user performs a bias each time the sensors are known to be unloaded. Ensure that the sensor has been unloaded for at least one second before performing a bias to ensure that the bias calculation does not include hysteresis effects. A bias operation can take up to 2 s. Ensure that the sensor remains unloaded throughout this time. An example of how to perform a bias is shown in Example 5.6. 


Example 5.6 – Biasing all pillars on all sensors


```python
# Send a BIAS request
res = listener.sendBiasRequest()
if res:
    print('main(): Successfully sent a BIAS request')
else:
    print('main(): FAILED to send a BIAS request')
    exit() 
```

# 5.5 Setting the Controller sampling rate

By default, upon powering up, the Controller will default to a sample rate of 1000 Hz. The Controller sampling rate can be changed to 100, 250, 500 or 1000 Hz. An example of how to change the Controller sampling rate to 500 Hz is shown in Example 5.7. 


Example 5.7 – Setting the Controller sampling rate


```python
# Setting the controller sampling rate
res = listener.setSamplingRate(PTSDK_CXX_Pybind.PTSDKConstants.SAMP_RATE_500)
if res:
    print('main(): Successfully set the sampling rate')
else:
    print('main(): FAILED to set the sampling rate')
    exit() 
```

# 5.6 Accessing sensor data

Once the PTSDKListener object is listening for and processing data and the sensors have been biased, the user application can access the incoming sensor data. Examples of how to access different types of data are shown in Example 5.8, Example 5.9 and Example 5.10. 


Example 5.8 – Accessing data from a whole sensor


```python

# 6 Log file

# 6.1 Overview


^ The torque reference point is the current tip position of the centre pillar (P4). 


If the PTSDKListener object was initialised with the isLogging flag being true, the function connectAndStartListening (in a multi-threaded application) and the PTSDK function readNextSample (in a single thread application) also generate a log file of the sensor data. 

# 6.2 Log file location

The log file that is generated is stored in the Logs subfolder in the same location as the userdefined application which uses the Python Library. 

# 6.3 Log file name

The name of the log file that is generated is LOG_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss.csv where: 

• YYYY is the four digit year, 

MM is the two digit month, 

DD is the two digit day, 

hh is the two digit hour, 

mm is the two digit minute and 

ss is the two digit second, 

from the system clock at the time that the log file was created. 

# 6.4 Log file format

The log file is saved as comma-separated values (CSV) in ASCII text format. The order of the values and a description is shown in Table 6.1
