# 1 Introduction

The PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) is a system of (up to) two PapillArray Tactile Sensor arrays and a Controller. Each PapillArray Tactile Sensor array can measure 3D displacement, 3D force, and vibration on each sensing element, as well as global 3D force, global 3D torque, the onset of slip, and friction. The Controller supplies power for (up to) two sensors and coordinates the simultaneous data acquisition from up to two PapillArray Tactile Sensors; i.e., coordinates sampling of the 9 pillars if one sensor is connected to the Controller, 18 pillars if two sensors are connected to the Controller. The Development Kit is shipped with visualisation software and (optional) C++ libraries for Windows and Linux environments and a ROS node for developing software control algorithms using the sensor signals. 

The main components of the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) are shown in Figure 1.1, connected to a laptop running the visualisation software.

# 2 Safety

# 2.1 General

The customer should verify that the maximum loads and moments expected during operation fall within the sensing range of the sensor as outside this range, sensor reading accuracy is not guaranteed (refer to Document #PTS_2.0_SPEC_DEC21). Particular attention should be paid to dynamic loads caused by robot acceleration and deceleration if the sensors are mounted on robotic equipment. These forces can be many multiples of the value of static forces in high acceleration or deceleration situations. 

# 2.2 Explanation of warnings

The warnings included here are specific to the product(s) covered by this manual. It is expected that the user heed all warnings from the manufacturers of other components used in the installation.

CAUTION: Sensors may exhibit a small offset in readings when exposed to intense light sources. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/6be56f84-0c73-48f3-97c7-dc32f497b434/9875040143d129e20ebb4fda2658f77335e0a5f51e8c32be37015efe1403da97.jpg)


CAUTION: Exceptionally strong and changing electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, constitute a possible source of interference with the operation of the sensor and Controller. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/6be56f84-0c73-48f3-97c7-dc32f497b434/800fe2b24a7443d71cffa201228dd3f6589f32808fc7b257245762f0203c2f6c.jpg)


CAUTION: Temperature variations can cause drift in sensor readings. Some temperature compensation is included in Development Kit version of the PapillArray. However, bias removal in software prior to operation is necessary, and it is recommended that biasing is performed each time the sensor is known to be unloaded. 

# 3 Getting started

This section contains instructions for setting up and using PapillArray Tactile Sensor Visualisation Software (v2.1). It is recommended that first time users first read the preceding Safety section, then read through this section to get more familiar with the system. 

# 3.1 Hardware installation

The visualisation software is used with the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0). The Controller should first be connected to the sensors and then to a PC via the micro-USB port on the Controller before you can use the visualisation software.

# 6 Display options

# 6.1 Visual representation of pillar displacement

The visual representation of the sensor takes a top view of the sensor pillars. Each pillar of the sensor is represented as a 2-D grey (when unloaded) or white (when loaded) shape with a cross hair representing the tip of the pillar. The representation of an unloaded sensor is shown alongside the physical sensor is shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 6.1 – Visual representation of sensor in GUI, including the X and Y axis orientation and internal temperature measurement; and corresponding physical sensor.


The cross hair moves left and right, and up and down to indicate positive and negative displacement of the pillar, in the X- and Y-axis depending upon the orientation of the visual representation (see Section 6.2 Rotating a sensor). The shape of the pillar representation deforms as a result of displacement in the X- and Y- axis. Additionally, Z displacement of the pillar is represented by a grey circle centred at the cross-hair – larger positive $\dot { Z }$ displacement results in a larger grey circle. Contact is represented by a change in the colour of the pillar – when the pillar is not in contact, it is grey, and when contact is made, the pillar becomes white. For visual purposes, the default threshold for a pillar to be considered in contact is 0.2 N in any one axis. Figure 6.2 shows an unloaded pillar, a pillar that is compressed to 1.5 N in the Z-axis, a pillar compressed to 5 N in the Z-axis, and a pillar compressed to 6 N in the Z-axis and displaced in the positive X-axis.

# 6.3 Internal temperature display

The internal temperature of the sensor is displayed as text in the bottom left corner of the visual representation of the sensor (see Figure 6.1). 

# 6.4 Slip detection and friction display

If slip detection is started (see Section 7.3 Start/stop slip detection) the slip status legend will appear between the two sensor visual representations. The slip status of each pillar is represented by a coloured ring surrounding the pillar in the visual representation. The current friction estimate is shown next to each sensor opposite the internal temperature display.

# 7.2 Biasing the sensor data

To bias the data (i.e., remove any offset in the calibrated displacement and force data), ensure that the sensor is unloaded and the signals are in a steady state, click on the Bias Sensors button (Figure 7.2). The bias operation takes approximately 2 s. Ensure that the sensor remains unloaded throughout this time. The sensor calibrated displacement and force signals should become zero after this point. 

# Bias Sensors

Figure 7.2 – Biasing the sensors 

If a bias is initiated in one instance of the visualisation software (connected to the MAIN), it will be processed in all running instances of the visualisation software as well as any program using the C++ library that is also reading from the same Controller (and vice versa). 

It is recommended that the sensors are biased each time the sensors are know to be unloaded – particularly during the first 20 minutes of operation when the sensors are warming up to a steadystate temperature. 

# 7.3 Start/stop slip detection

Slip detection can be activated by clicking the Start Slip Detection button. This will activate the slip detection algorithms on the controller, the slip status legend will appear between the two sensor visual representations and more (see Section 6.4 Slip detection and friction display). To stop slip detection, select the Stop Slip Detection button.
