# 1 Introduction

The PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) is a system of (up to) two PapillArray Tactile Sensor arrays and a Controller. Each PapillArray Tactile Sensor array can measure 3D displacement, 3D force, and vibration on each sensing element, as well as global 3D force, global 3D torque, the onset of slip, and friction. The Controller supplies power for (up to) two sensors and coordinates the simultaneous data acquisition from up to two PapillArray Tactile Sensors; i.e., coordinates sampling of the 9 pillars if one sensor is connected to the Controller, 18 pillars if two sensors are connected to the Controller. The Development Kit is shipped with visualisation software and (optional) C++ libraries for Windows and Linux environments and a ROS node for developing software control algorithms using the sensor signals. 

The main components of the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) are shown in Figure 1.1, connected to a laptop running the visualisation software.

This document is an installation and operation manual for the C++ Library for LINUX which was provided on the Contactile USB flash drive that was shipped with the Development Kit. 

# 2 Safety

# 2.1 General

The customer should verify that the maximum loads and moments expected during operation fall within the sensing range of the sensor as outside this range, sensor reading accuracy is not guaranteed (refer to Document #PTS_2.0_SPEC_DEC21). Particular attention should be paid to dynamic loads caused by robot acceleration and deceleration if the sensors are mounted on robotic equipment. These forces can be many multiples of the value of static forces in high acceleration or deceleration situations. 

# 2.2 Explanation of warnings

The warnings included here are specific to the product(s) covered by this manual. It is expected that the user heed all warnings from the manufacturers of other components used in the installation.

CAUTION: Sensors may exhibit a small offset in readings when exposed to intense light sources. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/62eb44f0-f8a4-455e-bda7-872399e00703/35221df4ac62bf69ffbf6eef57e0e91654da69b062e81a2e4a02f86d24ddcada.jpg)


CAUTION: Exceptionally strong and changing electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, constitute a possible source of interference with the operation of the sensor and Controller. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/62eb44f0-f8a4-455e-bda7-872399e00703/e1798f86a92e494578d2799d9de6b24ea7bb9fff4e83a66eb215ad11e4587ff8.jpg)


CAUTION: Temperature variations can cause drift in sensor readings. Some temperature compensation is performed. However, bias removal in software prior to operation is necessary, and it is recommended that biasing is performed each time the sensor is known to be unloaded. 

# 3 Getting started

This section contains instructions for setting up and using PapillArray Tactile Sensor C++ Library for LINUX (v2.0). It is recommended that first time users first read the preceding Safety section, then read through this section to get more familiar with the system. 

# 3.1 Hardware installation

The C++ Library is used with the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (Beta v2.0). The Controller should be connected to the PapillArray Tactile Sensors, then the Controller should be connected via the micro USB port on the Controller to a PC running LINUX before you can use the C++ Library. For more information about connecting the sensors and powering on the Controller, refer to Document #PTSDK_2.0_MAN_DEC21. 

# 3.2 End user licence agreement licence

Contactile's end user license agreement applies to all software and algorithms included with the products sold by Contactile. The end user license agreement that applies is provided on the USB flash drive shipped with the product in the folder ‘LEGAL’ in the root directory. 

# 3.3 Software installation

The C++ Library is provided on the Contactile USB flash drive that was shipped with the development kit in a folder named SOFTWARE/C++LIN. To install the library, simply copy the entire contents of the C++LIN folder to a location on a PC running LINUX.

# 5 Writing a user application using the C++ Library

This section contains code snippets to explain each step required to write a user application that uses the C++ Library to monitor two PapillArray Tactile Sensors. The full example can be found in the example.cpp file in the Example subfolder of the C++LIN folder. 

# 5.1 Include files

The examples for a user defined application in the following sections require the include files listed in Example 5.1. 


Example 5.1 – Include files for the example user application


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#ifndef PTSDCONSTANTS_H
#include "PTSDKConstants.h"
#endif
#ifndef PTSDLISTENER_H
#include "PTSDKListener.h"
#endif
#ifndef PTSDSENSOR_H
#include "PTSDKSensor.h"
#endif 
```

# 5.2 Initialising PTSDKSensor and PTSDKListener objects

To initialise a PTSDKListener object, first, the PTSDKSensor objects must be initialised. The following information is required to initialise the PTSDKSensor objects. An example of initialising two PTSDKSensor objects then initialising the PTSDKListener object is shown in Example 5.2. 


Example 5.2 – Initialising two PTSDKSensor objects and a PTSDKListener object


```c
/* Initialise a PTSDKSensor object for sensor connected to SEN0 port */
PTSDKSensor sen0 = PTSDKSensor();

/* Initialise a PTSDKSensor object for SEN1 sensor */
PTSDKSensor sen1 = PTSDKSensor();

/* Initialise the PTSDKListener object */
bool isLogging = true; // Create a log file
PTSDKListener listener = PTSDKListener(isLogging);

/* Add sensor 0 to the listener */
listener.addSensor(&sen0);

/* Add sensor 1 to the listener */
listener.addSensor(&sen1); 
```

# 5.3 Connecting to the COM port and listening for data

After initialising the PTSDKListener, a serial connection must be established. To connect to the COM port, the name of the COM port assigned to the connected Controller must be known. Once the PTSDKListener has established a connection with the COM port of the Controller, the Controller will begin transmitting data through the serial connection. 

There are two methods by which a user defined program can retrieve data from the Controller: 

1. Single thread 

2. Multi-threaded 

Note: There should be a COM port associated with the Controller (to power the Controller, the micro-USB should be connected between the micro-USB port on the Controller and the PC). This usually appears as /dev/ttyACM0. Ensure that the user has permissions to read/write to this COM port (by adding the user to the dialout group). 

# 5.3.1 COM port configuration parameters

The COM port configuration parameters are first required. An example of initialising the COM port configuration parameters is shown in Example 5.3. 


Example 5.3 – Connecting the PTSDKListener object to the COM port and listen for data in a single thread


```c
/* Initialise connection parameters */
char port[] = "/dev/ttyACMO"; // The name of the COM port to connect with
int rate = 9600; // The rate of the serial connection
int parity = 0; // 0=PARITY_NONE, 1=PARITY_ODD, 2=PARITY_EVEN
char byteSize = 8; // The number of bits in a byte 
```

# 5.3.2 Single thread

The structure of a user defined application using a single thread to retrieve sensor data from the Controller is shown in Example 5.4. 


Example 5.4 – Connecting to the COM port and listening for data in a single thread


```c
/* Connect to the serial port */
if(listener.connect(port, rate, parity, byteSize) == 0){
    printf("main(): Successfully connected to %s.\n", port);
} else{
    printf("main(): FAILED to connect to %s\n.", port);
    return -1;
}

bool isFlush = true; // Flush the hardware input buff if it contains too many bytes
while(true){
    /* Read the next sample from the Controller */
    if(listener.readNextSample(isFlush)){
    printf("main(): Successfully read the next sample.\n");
    } else{
    printf("main(): FAILED to read the next sample.\n");
    break;
    }

    /* Retrieve data from PTSDSensor objects and do something with it */
    // User specific code goes here - See Example 5.8, Example 5.9, and Example 5.10
}

/* Disconnect from the COM port */
listener disconnect(); 
```

# 5.3.3 Multi-threaded

The PTSDKListener object can launch a thread which listens for and processes the incoming data packets. An example of how to connect to the COM port and start listening for data using a new thread is shown in Example 5.5. 


Example 5.5 – Connecting to the COM port and listening for data in a multi-threaded application


```typescript
/* Connect to the serial port and start listening for and processing data */
bool isFlush = false;    // Don't flush hardware input buffer
if(listener.connectAndStartListening(port, rate, parity, byteSize, isFlush) == 0){
    printf("main(): Successfully connected to %s & started listening\n", port);
} else {
    printf("main(): FAILED to connect to %s, didn't start listening\n", port);
    return -1;
}

while(true){
    /* Retrieve data from PTSDSensor objects and o something with it */

# 5.4 Biasing the sensors

Biasing refers to removing any offset in the pillar readings when the pillars are unloaded. It is recommended that the user performs a bias each time the sensors are known to be unloaded. Ensure that the sensor has been unloaded for at least one second before performing a bias to ensure that the bias calculation does not include hysteresis effects. A bias operation can take up to 2 s. Ensure that the sensor remains unloaded throughout this time. An example of how to perform a bias is shown in Example 5.6. 


Example 5.6 – Biasing all pillars on all sensors


```c
/* Perform bias */
if(listener.sendBiasRequest()) {
    printf("main(): Successfully sent bias request.\n");
} else {
    printf("main(): FAILED to send bias request.\n");
    return -1;
} 
```

# 5.5 Setting the Controller sampling rate

By default, upon powering up, the Controller will default to a sample rate of 1000 Hz. The Controller sampling rate can be changed to 100, 250, 500 or 1000 Hz. An example of how to change the Controller sampling rate to 500 Hz is shown in Example 5.7. 


Example 5.7 – Setting the Controller sampling rate


```c
/* Set sampling rate */
if(listener.setSamplingRate(SAMP_RATE_500)) {
    printf("main(): Successfully set the sampling rate to 500 Hz.\n");
} else {
    printf("main(): FAILED to set the sampling rate to 500 Hz.\n");
    return -1;
} 
```

# 5.6 Accessing sensor data

Once the PTSDKListener object is listening for and processing data and the sensors have been biased, the user application can access the incoming sensor data. Examples of how to access different types of data are shown in Example 5.8, Example 5.9 and Example 5.10. 


Example 5.8 – Accessing data from a whole sensor


```c
/* Get the XYZ global force on sensor 1 */
double globalForce[NDIM];
sen1.getGlobalForce(globalForce);
for(int dInd = 0; dInd < NDIM; dInd++) {
    printf("S1: global F%d = %.3f\n", dInd, globalForce[dInd]);
}
printf("\n");

/* Get XYZ displacements of all pillars of sensor 1 */
double allDisplacements[NDIM][MAX_NPILLAR];
sen1.getAllDisplacements(allDisplacements);
for(int pInd = 0; pInd < sen1.getNPillar(); pInd++) {
    printf("S1_P%d", pInd);
    for(int dInd = 0; dInd < NDIM; dInd++) {
    printf("\tD%d = %.3f\n", dInd, allDisplacements[dInd][pInd]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
printf("\n"); 
```


Example 5.9 – Accessing data from a single pillar


```c
/* Retrieve and print the XYZ displacement of pillar 3 on sensor 0 */
int pInd = 3;
double displacement[NDIM];
sen0.getPillarDisplacements(pInd, displacement);
for(int dInd = 0; dInd < NDIM; dInd++) {
    printf("S0_P%d_D%d: %.3f\n", pInd, dInd, displacement[dInd]);
}

/* Retrieve and print the XYZ force of pillar 5 on sensor 0 */
pInd = 5;
double force[NDIM];
sen0.getPillarForces(pInd, force);
for(int dInd = 0; dInd < NDIM; dInd++) {
    printf("S0_P%d_F%d: %.3f\n", pInd, dInd, force[dInd]);
} 
```


Example 5.10 – Performing slip detection and estimating friction


```c
/* Start slip detection
* Only do this after a few pillars of each sensor are in contact
* and before a tangential load is applied.
* Not intended for slip detection in the presence of torsional loads.
*/
if(!listener.startSlipDetection()){
    printf("FAILED to start slip detection.\n");
    return -1;
}else{
    printf("Successfully started slip detection.\n");
}

/* Retrieve slip status and friction estimate
* This would be implemented in a loop
* Loop structure is dependent on single thread or multi-threaded application
*/

// Get slip states of all pillars in sensor 0
bool isSlipDetectionActive, isRefPillarLoaded, contactStates[MAX_NPILLAR];
int slipStates[MAX_NPILLAR];
sen0.getAllSlipStatus(&isSlipDetectionActive, &isRefPillarLoaded,
    contactStates, slipStates);
for(int pInd = 0; pInd < sen0.getNPillar(); pInd++){
    printf("S0_P%d: ",pInd);
    switch(slipStates[pInd]) {
    case INELIGIBLE:
    printf("was not in contact at slip detection start.\n");
    break;
    case CONTACT_AT_START:
    printf("in contact from slip detection start.\n");
    break;
    case LOST_CONTACT:
    printf("lost contact.\n");
    break;
    case TLOADING:
    printf("is being tangentially loaded\n");
    break;
    case SLIPPED:
    printf("slipped.\n");
    }
}

// Get the current friction estimate of sensor 0
double friction = sen0.getFrictionEstimate();
printf("S0: friction estimate = %.3f.\n\n",friction);

/* Stop slip detection */
if(!listener.stopSlipDetection()){
    printf("FAILED to stop slip detection.\n");
    return -1;
}else{
    printf("Successfully stopped slip detection.\n");
} 
```

# 6 Log file

# 6.1 Overview


^ The torque reference point is the current tip position of the centre pillar (P4). 


If the PTSDKListener object was initialised with the isLogging flag being true, the function connectAndStartListening (in a multi-threaded application) and the PTSDK function readNextSample (in a single thread application) also generate a log file of the sensor data. 

# 6.2 Log file location

The log file that is generated is stored in the Logs subfolder in the same location as the userdefined application which uses the C++ Library. 

# 6.3 Log file name

The name of the log file that is generated is LOG_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss.csv where: 

YYYY is the four digit year, 

MM is the two digit month, 

DD is the two digit day, 

hh is the two digit hour, 

mm is the two digit minute and 

ss is the two digit second, 

from the system clock at the time that the log file was created. 

# 6.4 Log file format

The log file is saved as comma-separated values (CSV) in ASCII text format. The order of the values and a description is shown in Table 6.1
