# 1 Introduction

The PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) is a system of (up to) two PapillArray Tactile Sensor arrays and a Controller. Each PapillArray Tactile Sensor array can measure 3D displacement, 3D force, and vibration on each sensing element, as well as global 3D force, global 3D torque, the onset of slip, and friction. The Controller supplies power for (up to) two sensors and coordinates the simultaneous data acquisition from up to two PapillArray Tactile Sensors; i.e., coordinates sampling of the 9 pillars if one sensor is connected to the Controller, 18 pillars if two sensors are connected to the Controller. The Development Kit is shipped with visualisation software and (optional) C++ libraries for Windows and Linux environments and a ROS node for developing software control algorithms using the sensor signals. 

The main components of the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) are shown in Figure 1.1, connected to a laptop running the visualisation software.

This document is an installation and operation manual for the ROS Node which was provided on the Contactile USB flash drive that was shipped with the Development Kit. 

# 2 Safety

# 2.1 General

The customer should verify that the maximum loads and moments expected during operation fall within the sensing range of the sensor as outside this range, sensor reading accuracy is not guaranteed (refer to Document #PTS_2.0_SPEC_DEC21). Particular attention should be paid to dynamic loads caused by robot acceleration and deceleration if the sensors are mounted on robotic equipment. These forces can be many multiples of the value of static forces in high acceleration or deceleration situations. 

# 2.2 Explanation of warnings

The warnings included here are specific to the product(s) covered by this manual. It is expected that the user heed all warnings from the manufacturers of other components used in the installation.

DANGER: Do not attempt to disassemble the sensor. This could damage the sensor and will invalidate the calibration.

DANGER: Do not attempt to drill, tap, machine, or otherwise modify the sensor casing. This could damage the sensor and will void invalidated the calibration.

DANGER: Do not use the sensor on abrasive surfaces or surfaces with sharp points/edges. This could damage the silicone surface of the sensor.

CAUTION: Sensors may exhibit a small offset in readings when exposed to intense light sources.

CAUTION: Exceptionally strong and changing electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, constitute a possible source of interference with the operation of the sensor and Controller. 

![image](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2026-05-16/f976ac3a-9f08-46fb-9eda-07c19b054da0/0b643bcddcfa0e3634458d3ebb224fc87042e4d09cd29c61d508a69f305cbc34.jpg)


CAUTION: Temperature variations can cause drift in sensor readings. Some temperature compensation is performed. However, bias removal in software prior to operation is necessary, and it is recommended that biasing is performed each time the sensor is known to be unloaded. 

# 3 Getting started

This section contains instructions for setting up and using PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0) ROS node. It is recommended that first time users first read the preceding Safety section, then read through this section to get more familiar with the system. 

# 3.1 Hardware installation

The ROS node is used with the PapillArray Tactile Sensor Development Kit (v2.0). The Controller should be connected to the PapillArray Tactile Sensors, then the Controller should be connected to a PC running LINUX via the micro USB port on the Controller before you can use the ROS node. For more information about connecting the sensors and powering on the Controller, refer to Document #PTSDK_2.0_MAN_DEC21. 

# 3.2 Minimum requirements

# 7.5 Log file

# 7.5.1 Overview

In the papillarray_ros_v2/src/papillarray_ros_node.cpp file (line 3) a PTSDKListener object (listener_) is initialised with a boolean argument that specifies whether to log data to a .csv file or not. The argument can be changed to true (to enable logging) or false (to disable logging), remembering that the node should be remade by a call to the catkin_make utility. 

# 7.5.2 Log file location

If logging is enabled, then a .csv log file will be generated and saved in the location /home/.ros/Logs. 

NB: The .ros folder is a hidden location – make sure that you can view hidden files. 

# 7.5.3 Log file name

The name of the log file that is generated is LOG_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss.csv where: 

YYYY is the four digit year, 

• MM is the two digit month, 

DD is the two digit day, 

hh is the two digit hour, 

mm is the two digit minute and 

• ss is the two digit second, 

from the system clock at the time that the log file was created. 

# 7.5.4 Log file format

The log file is saved as comma-separated values (CSV) in ASCII text format. See PTSC++LIN_2.0_MAN_MMMYY.pdf for information on the order of the values and a description.
